Recurrent Neural Network is a class of neural networks which uses its internal memory to process a sequence of inputs, which makes it the recommended framework for sequential inputs such as text, speech or audio. The "memory" means that RNN performs the same task for every element of a sequence with each output being dependent on all previous computations, which is like "remembering" information about what has been processed so far.
